## Purpose

This document defines role-based access control (RBAC) for the Fuel Pump ERP platform.

It serves as the foundation for:

- Backend authorization
    
- Frontend access control
    
- Screen visibility
    
- API permissions
    
- Row-Level Security (RLS)
    
- Future Enterprise permission customization
    

This document reflects the MVP authorization model and intentionally prioritizes simplicity over complexity.

# Authorization Principles

## Principle 1: Simplicity First

The MVP uses fixed system roles.

Roles:

```text
Owner
Manager
Accountant
Staff
```

Custom roles are deferred to Enterprise plans.

---

## Principle 2: Visibility Over Restriction

Operational transparency is preferred wherever possible.

Most users can view operational data relevant to their station.

This improves accountability and discourages malpractice.

---

## Principle 3: Shift Ownership

All operational actions occur within active shifts.

Permissions are primarily evaluated against:

```text
Organization
Station
Role
Shift State
```

---

## Principle 4: Locked Data Cannot Be Modified

Once a shift becomes locked:

```text
No Direct Editing
```

Only adjustment entries may be created.

Authorization rules cannot bypass this business rule.
